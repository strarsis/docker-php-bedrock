# docker-php-bedrock
Docker image for PHP with roots.io [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock) WordPress sites, attempting high parity with roots.io [Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis) PHP FPM.

## PHP releases
There are two branches available:
[PHP 7](https://github.com/strarsis/docker-php-bedrock/tree/php7)
[PHP 8](https://github.com/strarsis/docker-php-bedrock/tree/php8)

## Architecture

### Comparison with the WordPress Docker Hub image
This image isn't derived from the [Docker Hub WordPress](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress) repository, as the WordPress core of Bedrock based sites is installed as a dependency using `composer`. The roots.io packaged WordPress core has also its default themes stripped (https://github.com/roots/bedrock/pull/555).

### WP CLI
The docker-php-bedrock image tries to contain only a sane runtime for WordPress Bedrock applications and no other tooling like WP CLI support or SSH access.
Instead a [WP CLI](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress?tab=tags&page=1&ordering=last_updated&name=cli) container should be connected with and mounted into the container, so that it can access the WordPress configuration and site database for maintenance.
